# Machine Learning
Several machine learning models implemented from scratch for the analyze their behaviours on different datasets.
## Repository Description
Each Jupyter file contains several components mainly consisting of the following:
1. Data Importing
2. Data CLeaning and Preparation
3. Model Implementation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Predictions
6. Additional Experimentations.
## Models implemented
-KNN and DT
-Regression(Linear regression and Multiclass regression)
-NeuralNetwork (Multi-layer Preceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks)
